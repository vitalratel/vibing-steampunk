### Phase 5: TAS-Style Debugging (v2.14-2.15) ✅

**Goal:** Scriptable, replayable debugging inspired by Tool-Assisted Speedruns.

#### 5.1 Lua Scripting Integration
- [x] Integrate gopher-lua into vsp
- [x] Expose all MCP tools to Lua
- [x] Create Lua REPL for interactive debugging
- [x] Document scripting API (examples + reports)

```lua
-- Target API
while true do
    local event = waitForBreakpoint(30)
    if not event then break end
    saveState("checkpoint_" .. event.hit_count)
    stepOver()
end
```

**Effort:** 2 weeks
**Files:** `pkg/scripting/lua.go`, `internal/mcp/lua_bindings.go`

#### 5.2 Variable History Recording
- [x] Design execution frame structure
- [x] Implement frame capture at each debug step
- [x] Delta compression for storage efficiency
- [x] "Show state at step N" command

```go
type ExecutionFrame struct {
    StepNumber int
    Location   CodeLocation
    Variables  map[string]Variable
    DBOps      []DBOperation
    RFCCalls   []RFCCall
}
```

**Effort:** 2 weeks
**Files:** `pkg/adt/recorder.go`, `pkg/adt/history.go`

#### 5.3 Checkpoint System
- [x] Serialize variable state to JSON
- [x] Store checkpoints locally (in-memory + file)
- [x] Restore checkpoint (variable inspection)
- [x] Checkpoint management commands (save/get/list)

#### 5.4 Watchpoint Scripting
- [x] Scriptable watchpoint conditions
- [x] All breakpoint types: line, statement, exception, message, BAdi, enhancement, watchpoint, method
- [x] 8 breakpoint type functions in Lua

#### 5.5 Force Replay (State Injection)
- [x] SetVariable API (modify variables in live session)
- [x] InjectCheckpoint (restore all variables from checkpoint)
- [x] ForceReplay (inject state from recording at specific step)
- [x] ReplayFromStep (inject state from current recording)

```lua
-- The killer feature: Inject production state into dev session
forceReplay("production_dump_001")  -- Inject and debug!
```

#### 5.6 Testing & Documentation
- [x] 59 unit tests (recorder, history, Lua bindings)
- [x] E2E test script (`examples/scripts/phase5-experiment.lua`)
- [x] Testing methodology report
- [x] Data extraction examples report
- [x] Live experiment documentation
